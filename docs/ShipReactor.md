# ShipReactor

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**symbol** | **String** | Symbol of the reactor. | 
**name** | **String** | Name of the reactor. | 
**description** | **String** | Description of the reactor. | 
**condition** | **f64** | The repairable condition of a component. A value of 0 indicates the component needs significant repairs, while a value of 1 indicates the component is in near perfect condition. As the condition of a component is repaired, the overall integrity of the component decreases. | 
**integrity** | **f64** | The overall integrity of the component, which determines the performance of the component. A value of 0 indicates that the component is almost completely degraded, while a value of 1 indicates that the component is in near perfect condition. The integrity of the component is non-repairable, and represents permanent wear over time. | 
**power_output** | **i32** | The amount of power provided by this reactor. The more power a reactor provides to the ship, the lower the cooldown it gets when using a module or mount that taxes the ship's power. | 
**requirements** | [**models::ShipRequirements**](ShipRequirements.md) |  | 
**quality** | **f64** | The overall quality of the component, which determines the quality of the component. High quality components return more ships parts and ship plating when a ship is scrapped. But also require more of these parts to repair. This is transparent to the player, as the parts are bought from/sold to the marketplace. |
